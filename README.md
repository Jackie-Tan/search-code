Main code: apply_patches.py

Example command: apply_patches.py 0(start_index) 100(end_index)

Outline: The code assumes that the data file to read is called 'final_data_v3.csv', and it exists in the same directory as apply_patches.py. The 2 input arguments are the starting and ending index of your choice, but must be within the limits of the csv data. Logs of the code are saved in the same directory, an example being: "app-20231204.log"
